/**
 * TeamMarquee
 * A "My team" heading followed by a horizontal line of team-member cards
 * that scrolls continuously left -> right. Hover pauses it so the cards
 * are still readable/clickable.
 *
 * Theming is CSS-only, driven by body.dark-mode / body.light-mode set
 * elsewhere in the app — no props needed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   <TeamMarquee />
